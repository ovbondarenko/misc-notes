# Sourdough starter

Sourdough starter can be stored at room temperature for every day baking or in refrigerator for occasional baking. While the feeding instructions are identical regardless of the storage, maintanence and refreshment schedules will be different, as described below.

## Feeding the starter

**Basic refreshment recipe:**
- Prepare clean glassware, a utensil for mixing the starter and a kitchen scale (I prefer 8oz mason jar and a silicon spatula, but anything else will do)
- Weigh 10g of whole wheat flour and 40g of all-purpose flour
- Add 40g of lukewarm water
- Add 10-20g of active (mature) starter. The remaining active starter can either be discarded, refrigerated for the future use or baked with.
- Mix everything together until homogeneous.
- Cover with a lid or saran wrap and leave on the counter until the newly mixed starter achieves its peak volume. The starter should expand to 2-2.5 times of its original volume. How long it takes depends on ambient temperature, usually somewhere between 6 and 10 hours.
- Now the starter is ready for adding to the bread dough or storing.

**Note:** The above recipe is just a suggestion, in reality the flour can be either entirely all purpose or entirely whole wheat of some mixture thereof. However, the water amount may need to be adjusted (e.g., to increase water amount substantially, by 20-40% for all whole-wheat flour, since it has higher water absorption capacity than all purpose flour)

## Refreshment schedule

### Room temperature storage
Someone who likes to bake every day or a few times a week, might want to keep their starter at room temperature and feed the starter as described above 2-3 times every 24 hr, depending on how fast the starter develops.

### Refregirated storage
I bake a few times a month, so I store my starter in the fridge. I have established experimentally that the starter can survive in the fridge without any feedidngs at least a couple of weeks. Once I left it unattended for a month, and it bounced right back when I fed it.

Ideally, the starter should be refreshed before the "hooch" layer is formed at the top, but its appearance does not mean that the starter is dead. The yeast is actually a very robust culture. Feed it anyway, and chances are it will thrive again. You might want to refresh it 2-3 times at room temperature before baking if you feel that the culture is not as vigorous as it used to be.
